# Learn

Welcome to the Learn application ! This app is a sleek and attractive application made for my self learning. The name Learn is given so I learn how to create a basic app with my knowledge. It was created based on a stunning design layout from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5VHJ77tiYeZp8ICO6azVKr/Replica?node-id=1%3A577&t=VD0zAjJfezsYfacd-1) , a popular design collaboration platform.
